# Course Project for Applied Data Analysis with Python

Student: Etienne Richard (enrolled 4 February 2019)

This is the submission for the course project of _Course 2 - Applied Data Analysis with Python_ in the _Applied Data Science: Machine Learning_ program.

Notes:
* The submission consists in 6 Jupyter Notebook files `course-02-project-task-{a,b,c,d,e,f}.ipynb` with all outputs included. Please, let me know if I should submit it with all outputs cleared in the future.
* First run `course-02-project-task-a.ipynb` to generate the cleaned-up dataset used by the other tasks.
* The dataset `en.openfoodfacts.org.products.tsv` is *not included* and should be placed in the same directory.
* Git repository: `project-adsml19-c2-s9-1496`
